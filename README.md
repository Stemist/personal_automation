# personal_automation

Summary: Scripts to automate computer-based tasks such as troubleshooting and downloading software.

Usage: Run scripts as sudo, e.g. "sudo ./script_name"

Rationale: I often have to perform very similar sets of commands on a daily basis. Here I will develop a collection of tools to make my and my coworkers' lives easier. My intention is to have these pre-installed or rolled with a Linux distro USB at my workplace to allow them to be immediately accessable.

Planned scripts:
1) Script that automates both mounting of Windows partitions + deletion of Windows Temp files (with user prompting to avoid unintentional deletion).
2) Change NT Password script, that ensures the tool chntpw from the Ubuntu Universe repo is both sourced, installed and run automatically.
